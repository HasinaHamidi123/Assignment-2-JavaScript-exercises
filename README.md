## Exercise 1: Function Pipeline

### Overview
This exercise demonstrates a simple implementation of a function pipeline in JavaScript, allowing users to input a number, which is then processed through a series of functions: `addFive`, `multiplyByThree`, and `subtractTwo`.

### Code Explanation
#### HTML Structure
- Contains an input field for user number entry and a button to trigger the function pipeline.
- Displays the result in a designated area.

#### CSS Styles
- Basic styling for a clean, user-friendly interface, centering the container and enhancing usability with padding and shadows.

#### JavaScript Functionality
1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `addFive`: Adds 5 to the input value.
   - `multiplyByThree`: Multiplies the input value by 3.
   - `subtractTwo`: Subtracts 2 from the input value.

2. **Function Pipeline Implementation**:
   - Uses `functionPipeline` to apply a series of functions sequentially.

3. **Event Listener**:
   - Listens for button clicks to retrieve user input, validate it, and display the result.

### User Experience
- Immediate feedback on calculations after input and button click.

### Accessibility
- User-friendly design with proper labels for input fields and buttons.

## Exercise 2: HTTP Client

### Overview
This exercise implements a basic HTTP client that allows users to perform various API requests, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations.

### Code Explanation
#### HTML Structure
- User interface includes sections for each HTTP request type, with corresponding buttons and input fields.

#### Request Implementations
- **GET Request**: Fetches data from an API and displays it.
- **POST Request**: Sends data to create a new post and displays the response.
- **PUT Request**: Updates an existing post and shows the updated details.
- **DELETE Request**: Deletes a post by ID and displays the result.

#### Error Handling
- Each request is wrapped in try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully.

## Exercise 3: Drag-and-Drop Interface

### Overview
This exercise implements a drag-and-drop interface, allowing users to move items from a list into a designated area.

### Code Explanation
#### HTML Structure
- Contains draggable items and a drop area.

#### CSS Styles
- Visually appealing layout with styled draggable items and drop area.

#### JavaScript Functions
- **allowDrop(event)**: Allows dropping items in the designated area.
- **drag(event)**: Captures the dragged item's ID.
- **drop(event)**: Handles dropping items into the area.

### User Interaction
- Users can dynamically drag and drop items, updating the interface accordingly.

### Error Handling
- Designed to manage empty states effectively, though specific error handling is minimal.

## Exercise 4: Function Pipeline (Repeat)

### Overview
This exercise demonstrates a function pipeline, allowing users to input a number and see the result after processing it through a series of functions.

### Code Explanation
- Similar structure to Exercise 1 with clear explanations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.

### User Interaction
- Users enter numeric values, click a button, and receive feedback on valid or invalid inputs.

### Error Handling
- Basic validation for numeric input with alerts for invalid entries.

## Exercise 5: Lazy Loading Images

### Overview
This exercise demonstrates lazy loading images using the Intersection Observer API. The application loads a set of images from Lorem Picsum only when they become visible in the viewport, improving performance and user experience.

### Code Explanation
#### HTML Structure
- Contains a heading and a container where images will be dynamically loaded.
- Images are added to the `.image-container` div using JavaScript.

#### CSS Styles
- Basic styles ensure a clean and responsive layout.
- The image container uses CSS Grid for a flexible and adaptive design.
- Images are styled with rounded corners and a smooth opacity transition for when they are loaded.

#### JavaScript Functionality
1. **DOM Content Loaded Event**:
   - The script executes after the DOM is fully loaded, ensuring elements are available for manipulation.

2. **Image Loading Function**:
   - The `loadImages` function creates ten `<img>` elements with a `data-src` attribute containing random image URLs from Lorem Picsum.
   - The `alt` attribute is set for accessibility.

3. **Intersection Observer**:
   - An `IntersectionObserver` monitors when images enter the viewport and sets the `src` attribute from `data-src` to load the image.
   - The observer stops tracking the image once it has loaded.

4. **Loading Images**:
   - The `loadImages` function is called to initiate the image loading process upon page load.

### User Experience
- Images start hidden with an opacity of 0 and fade in smoothly once loaded.
- The lazy loading technique ensures images are requested only when needed, reducing initial load time and resource usage.

### Accessibility
- The use of the `alt` attribute on images improves accessibility for users relying on screen readers.
